Fall 2013 Santa Clara University 
====
There were 6 assignments for this class I refer to in this repository: 


1. A basic Node to implement a list in a later project
2. A Tree Implementation with those Nodes
3. Random Number Generator with a First In First Out Queue (using 1 and 2) and the Simulation and Analysis
4. Primm's Algorithm implemented in Java
5. Diksmm Algorithm implemented in Java

For reference: 

Trees and Nodes are used to create the queue and nodes of the tree to perform the algorithims below: 

Random Number Generator is used to create the path distances for this simulation

Primm's Algorithm
This algorithim uses a tree model to first map out the ends of a newtork, in this case a tree, and then find the shortest path on all the leaves within that tree. 

Dijkstra's Algorithy
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm
It helps find the shortest path for a route on a network.
